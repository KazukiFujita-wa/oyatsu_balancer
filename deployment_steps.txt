# Render Deployment Steps for oyatsu-balancer

This file outlines the steps for deploying the oyatsu-balancer application to Render.

## Deployment Method

This project is configured for deployment using the `render.yaml` file.
Simply connect your Git repository to Render, and it will automatically detect `render.yaml` and set up the services.

## Manual Deployment / Environment Variables

If you choose to set up the services manually instead of using `render.yaml`, you will need to configure the following environment variables in your Web Service on the Render dashboard.

### Web Service Environment Variables

- **APP_URL**: The public URL of your application (e.g., `https://oyatsu-balancer.onrender.com`). You can use `${RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL}` to have Render automatically set this.
- **APP_KEY**: A unique, 32-character random string for Laravel. You can generate one locally using `php artisan key:generate --show`. **IMPORTANT**: Set this once and do not change it.
- **APP_ENV**: Set to `production`.
- **DB_CONNECTION**: Set to `pgsql`.
- **DB_HOST**: The internal hostname of your Render PostgreSQL database.
- **DB_PORT**: The port for your Render PostgreSQL database.
- **DB_DATABASE**: The database name from your Render PostgreSQL service.
- **DB_USERNAME**: The username from your Render PostgreSQL service.
- **DB_PASSWORD**: The password from your Render PostgreSQL service.

These database variables will be available for you to copy from the "Info" section of your PostgreSQL database service on Render. You can link them as a group to your web service.

## Post-Deployment

After a successful deployment, the application should be running and accessible at your Render URL. The entrypoint script (`docker-entrypoint.sh`) handles database migrations and application optimizations automatically.
